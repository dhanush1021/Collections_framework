# Time Complexity

+ Time complexity is denoted using Asymptotic Notations.
+ There are three types of asymptotic notations :
  * Big O (Worst Case)
  * Theta θ (Average Case)
  * Omega Ω (Best Case)

# Data Structure
+ Linear
  * Array
  * Linked List
  * Stack
  * Queue

+ Non-Linear
  * Trees
  * BitMap
  * Graphs
  * Trie

# Algorithm
  * Brute Force
  * Greedy Approach
  * Recursion
